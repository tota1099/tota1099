## I'm a software developer

Always looking to improve, I am passionate about technology. 

Nowadays I work professionally as a PHP programmer, and regularly study technologies like Python and NodeJS.

I spent the last years studying and applying software architectures and good practices (clean architecture and clean code), and working with cloud environments (AWS and continuous integration).
